# stock-market-volatility

# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the historical stock market data for MAANG companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) to assess stock market volatility from 2021 to 2023. The goal is to explore and visualize the volatility of these stocks and provide insights into their performance over the specified period.

# Dataset
The dataset contains historical stock market data for the following companies:

Microsoft

Apple

Amazon

Netflix

Google

# Columns in the Dataset

Date: The date of the stock data.

Open: The price of the stock at the opening of the trading day.

Close: The price of the stock at the closing of the trading day.

High: The highest price of the stock during the trading day.

Low: The lowest price of the stock during the trading day.

Adj Close: The adjusted closing price accounting for dividends and stock splits.

Volume: The number of shares traded during the trading day.

# Objectives

Analyze Stock Volatility: Evaluate the volatility of each stock by calculating daily returns and other volatility measures.

Compare Performance: Compare the volatility and performance of the MAANG companies over the specified time period.

Visualize Trends: Create visualizations to showcase stock price movements, volatility, and trading volumes.

# Development Process
